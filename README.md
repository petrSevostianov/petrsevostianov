This study is focused on exploring nonlinear gamut transforms done by cinema cameras. Those transforms make image non-linear and damage the most of techniques in virtual production such as keying, lighting calibration and led wall to camera matching. Since these transforms are not publicly documented, the goal is to reverse-engineer them. The article describes the methodology of measuring, canceling and re-applying such transforms.
